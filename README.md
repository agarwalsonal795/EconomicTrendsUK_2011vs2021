**Socio-Economic and Ethnic Trends in England and Wales(2011â€“2021)**

This report explores changes in ethnic diversity and labour market across England and Wales, based on
data from the 2011 and 2021 UK Censuses. It uses data analysis and visual tools to better understand
these trends. To deal with missing information and merged areas in the 2021 data, the study uses Bayesian
statistical techniques. These include estimating missing values and breaking down combined district data
to show local-level contributions more accurately. Interactive dashboards, maps, and advanced visualization
tools like PCA and t-SNE were used to reveal detailed patterns in employment, job types, and industry
participation across different ethnic groups and regions. The results show ongoing inequalities, changing
participation rates, and new job trends among ethnic communities. Overall, the goal is to provide useful
insights that can guide better policy decisions, highlighting both improvements and continuing issues in
employment and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds.
